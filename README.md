# Unity 3D - Basic Gameplay Prototype

This is the working project for the Basic Gameplay portion of Unity's Programmer Pathways. It address the basic requirements as well as the bonus challenges. 

During the development of the basic gameplay, I also noticed improvements and small features that I'd like to implement at some point to improve the whole experience.
